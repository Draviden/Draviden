- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Draviden
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Learning and improving on Python and Data Science. I have created a few small programs which helped me get into development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust programming language and Data Science

Not sure what to say in here yet as I am not quite the expert with words. Like someone I know says "Not here for a long time but a good time"
